in this video we want to have Tab component =>

something like : 
<>
    <menu>
        BUTTONS
    </menu>
    {children}
</>

=> we need to have additional slot for JSX code 

you can pass JSX code as value whenever you want 
** whenever you are using JSX code as a value in some place :
    - the value being returned in component 
    - a value being stored in a variable 
    
    you have to make sure that there's only one *root element* =>
        - we could add a wrapper around => <div> </div> , <></>


=> being able to set multiple slots in component
