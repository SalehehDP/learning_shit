*output some content conditionally 

! need to do alot in React 

** there are different approaches : 

    - {} , use ternary expression **?** 

        {selectedTopic === undefined} === {!selectedTopic} // if it's not truthy

        {!selectedTopic ? ---- : ++++ }   
        ===
        if !selectedTopic {
            show ----
        }else {
            show ++++
        }

        {selectedTopic !== undefined} === {selectedTopic}  // if it's truthy
    

        => use two opposite conditions with else null , can be merge in to one if

    -  && , the AND operator 

        it will actuallly output the value comes after it if the condition in front of it yields true 

        {!selectedTopic && ----}   
        in this case we use two conditions => can lead tomore readable code 


    - use a variable 
        let tabContent = (some JSX code); 

        if (selectedTopic){
            tabContent = (some new JSX code);
        }

        => that leads to leaner JSX code
