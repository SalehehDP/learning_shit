we want to know wich button was clicked

*define a function that should be exeuted upon an event :

onEvent = {() => handleEvent(argValue)}


*but you also want to control how it's going to be and wich argument are going to be passed to it :(use arrow function syntax)

onEvent = {() => handleEvent(argValue)}
