<p>At this point, you've built a first custom component and you, of course, also worked with the <code>App</code> component.</p><p>For the moment, both components are stored in the <code>App.jsx</code> file (this will change later though).</p><p><code>.jsx</code> is a file extension that's not supported by the browser! It's working because you're working in a React project that supports this special extension. Because this extension <em>"tells"</em> the underlying build process (which is running behind the scenes when the development server is running)&nbsp;that a file contains JSX code (which is also not supported by browsers).</p><p>It's important to understand that it's really just that build process that cares about this extension.</p><p>And therefore, you'll also find React projects that <strong>don't use</strong> <code>.jsx</code> but instead just <code>.js</code> as a file extension. And in those <code>.js</code> files, you'll also find JSX&nbsp;code. Because it simply depends on the underlying build process which extension is expected when using this JSX&nbsp;syntax in a file.</p><p>Since it doesn't work in the browser either way, there is no hard rule regarding this. Instead, you'll find projects that require <code>.jsx</code> (like the project setup we use in this course) and you'll find projects that also support <code>.js</code> (with JSX code inside).</p><p>I'm emphasizing this here so that you're not confused if you encounter React projects that don't use .jsx files.</p><p>In addition, you'll also find projects that require the<strong> file extension as part of file imports</strong> (e.g., <code>import App from './App.jsx'</code>) and you'll find other projects that don't require this (i.e., there, you could just use <code>import App from './App'</code>).</p><p>This, again, has nothing to do with the browser or <em>"standard JavaScript"</em> - instead it simply depends on the requirements of the code build process that's part of the project setup you chose.</p>
