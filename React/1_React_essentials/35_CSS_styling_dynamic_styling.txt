* Dynamic styling 

    we want to selected tab be highlighted =>
    setting a class to button that was selected =>
    className prop (JSX-specific in html is class) =>
    className = "active" =>
    now the goal is to set className dynamically


    => get another prop *isSelected* , use ternary expression => set attributes conditionally
